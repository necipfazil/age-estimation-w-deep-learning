## Age estimation based on deep learning models
An age estimation solution that:
* Trains a neural network with given image&age data,
* Produces age estimations on image data using the trained neural network.

[The implementation](age_estimation.py) was prepared by making use of the python machine learning library: [PyTorch](pytorch.org).

[The report file](Report.pdf) depicts the usage of the deep learning on the given problem by explaining the method and the evaluation.
